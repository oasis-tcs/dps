### Abstract
**Editor's Note:**
we need to put text here

Best practices: 

- Expect this text to be reused in multiple other places to explain the specification in summary form.  
- This is not the TC or OP scope (which is an IPR and rules boundary);  rather, this section is the summary intended purpose of this specification.  
- Short is better; four paragraphs or less is recommended.  
- If use of this spec is deliberately created to rely on or complement another standard, consider briefly mentioning that here as context.  
- To the extent that discussion of the larger context of the spec, or its history, or the circumstances that led to its creation or revision, are necessary, they belong in the Introduction, not here.

OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable.
