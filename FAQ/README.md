# Frequently Asked Questions

Eventually this page will contain an organized list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).
In the meantime it will contain a list of links to adjacent files 
which are one question and answer per file.
THis allows the FAQs to be developed independently until we have enough agreement 
to move them into a more coherent organization.
