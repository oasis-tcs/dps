# What are the benefits of implementing Data Provenance Standards?

Adopting these standards enhances data transparency, 
which produces a range of business value. 
At minimum, the transparency can lead to efficiency and cost savings by decreasing time 
to data acquisition, cleanup and pre-processing. 
It also improves quality assurance and security, 
which are  foundational to innovating and building new value with data. 
Finally, this data transparency can help organizations seeking to comply 
with existing and emerging data protection laws and provisions in AI regulation. 
In sum, these standards are designed to increase trust in data use and sharing 
between organizations and with consumers.
