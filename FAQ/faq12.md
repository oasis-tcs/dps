# How does this work relate to the work in the Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC?

The [Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-osim/) 
is developing standards for structuring and exchanging of supply chain information, 
enabling interoperability, transparency, and eï¬ƒciency across industries.
Provenance, especially because of it's correlation to trust, is especially important
to many supply chain use cases. 

For these supply chain use cases, the DPS provenance standards will increase business value, 
ease implementation, and assist with complying with new and emerging regulation.
