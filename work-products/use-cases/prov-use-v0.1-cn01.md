#### Abstract:

Identifying, managing, and governing your data as an independent asset today is critical for trustworthy transparency,
regulatory and legal basis alignment, and use in AI.
Trust in the insights and decisions coming from both traditional data and AI applications depends on understanding the origin,
lineage, and rights associated with the data that drives them.
Lack of transparency has real costs, including unnecessary risks and foregone opportunities.
And yet, many organizations today cannot answer basic data questions without considerable difficulty and investment of people and disparate tools.

To realize the value of data requires a reliable cross-industry baseline of data provenance (source and legal processing basis) and
lineage (data processing's what, where, who, and how) as data is valued, governed, and managed across industries from customer to
data processor to sub-processor.
The Data Provenance standards propose a solution to standardized throughout the data's life cycle.
These use case scenarios showcase how the Data Provenance standards support diverse needs across the data ecosystem.

# 1 Introduction

Standardizing metadata (the descriptors) for data provenance and lineage that you are processing allows the automation of data management
(storage, deletion, localization, sharing &amp; backup requirements) governance
(allowances, restrictions and required controls given legal basis of processing, regulations, and policies),
data usage (type, age of data, source location, type of data, personal data, known bias, etc).

## 1.1 Background: Motivation for Standardization now

Data has traditionally been siloed, managed, and governed by application (built-in controls and defined processes) and
user of that application (contract or other legal basis).

In today's world where data is being sought for its value, its use in innovation, its processing alignment to regulations,
and its trustworthiness via transparency and observability, data requires to be treated as an independent asset.
To be independent, data must know itself by maintaining its provenance and tracking its lineage.
Standardized provenance and lineage metadata provides consistent identifiers to allow data to be independent as
it traverses its processing lifecycle from creation/collection, use, storage/retention, sharing, and deletion.

## 1.2 Purpose

These uses cases are examples of how the provenance and lineage metadata provide the foundational information to
maximize the data value while minimizing the processing risk.

## 1.3 Terminology

This CN uses the definitions contained in the [[Provenance Metadata
Specification](#prov-md-v10)], section whatever. The following
additional terms are defined for this document:

- **next:** definition here with ref to where got if we didn't create
- **Seed dataset:** definition here with ref to where got if we didn't creat
- **Underlying dataset(s):** definition here with ref to where got if we didn't create

"Internal Use Only" denotes there is no sensitive information contained in the dataset, but there are reasons for restrictions,
most likely legal in nature.
Maya will look at the license information and work with the legal team to determine what the limitations might be.

### 5.5.16 Confidentiality Classification{#uc4--standards-use--confidentiality-classification}

Because PETs were used and declared in the previous metadata,
this metadata field is grayed out for the data supplier when assigning metadata and Maya doesn't see any values presented.

### 5.5.17 Consent Location{#uc4--standards-use--consent-location}

Because PETs were used and declared in the previous metadata,
this metadata field is grayed out for the data supplier when assigning metadata and Maya doesn't see any values presented.

### 5.5.18 Data Processing Geography{#uc4--standards-use--data-processing-geography}

"[[globaltradedatahub.com/license/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000](http://globaltradedatahub.com/license/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000)".
While she scans the license information,
she knows that she will need the legal department's eyes and sign off before proceeding with the purchase of the dataset.
She routes the license,
along with her question around specific data content classification to her colleagues in the legal department for consideration and approval.

### 5.5.21 Intent{#uc4--standards-use--intent}

Maya reviews the dataset intent, and notices that the data is intended for "AI, Training", which aligns with her project goals.
The declaration also signals to Maya that the premium price placed on the dataset is appropriate because it is intended and
expected to be of higher quality than data intended for other uses.

### 5.5.22 Proprietary Data Presence{#uc4--standards-use--proprietary-data-presence}

Maya reviews the metadata around proprietary data presence and notes that there is a contact listed for the copyright.
She flags the values "Jonathan Reeves, Esq., Email: jreeves@globaltradedatahublegal.com, Phone: +1-555-012-3456" for her legal colleagues to
