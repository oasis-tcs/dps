### Abstract

This OASIS Data Provenance Metadata specification provides an information model and several specialized data schemata for describing and managing data provenance.
The intended use addresses transparency in AI, cybersecurity, supply chains, and other areas where data quality and accountability are foundational to performance
and compliance \- especially in regulated and high-risk environments.

# 5 Provenance Information Model

The information model of the provenance metadata is described in human-readable property tables.
The technical encoding may be found in section 6.

The Data Provenance Standards are made up of three groups of metadata elements:
Source, Provenance, and Use.

![Metadata](./images//metadata.svg)

The property tables first define metadata about the specification itself,
then describe how a record is made of the 3 primary metadata elements
(Source, Provenance, and Use), then describe each of the 3 elements.
Subsequent tables describe the underlying fields of the 3 elements.

## 5.1 Primary Metadata Elements

# 8 Safety, Security, and Data Protection Considerations

\<

This section is **REQUIRED** and **MUST** be the second to last numbered section in the document, right before Conformance. This section contains information about safety, security, data protection, and privacy considerations. These can be divided up into separate subsections as desired. All documents **SHOULD** have at least a security and data protection considerations section, and otherwise **MUST** have a blank section indicating âNone.â Any other considerations **MAY** also be added.

Please note that any specification that will need to register something with IANA or has plans to go on to ITU/ISO/IEC **MUST** have this section filled out. For an example please see the following section in the CACAO specification here [https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/cs01/security-playbooks-v2.0-cs01.html\#\_Toc152256574](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/cs01/security-playbooks-v2.0-cs01.html#_Toc152256574)
