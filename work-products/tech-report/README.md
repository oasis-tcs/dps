# Technical Report

> OASIS Data Provenance Standards - Ensuring Provenance and Permitted Use of Data on any Scale across Organizations

This folder contains the technical report that may serve as paper during conferences or as an information item
that spans from execetutive briefing level via use cases to the metadata core specification.

The goal for this technical report is to provide a balanced overview to readers interested in managing data provenance correctly.

Note: The images folder currently holds the SVG copied from our core spec strawman and the derived PNG format.
