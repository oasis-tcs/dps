# Explorations of a Data Provenance Schema

This contribution licensed under MIT explores a possible schema evolution of the
contributed JSON Schema from the Data and trust Alliance.

The main goals are:

1. Do not fight the schema language (use $defs etc.)
2. Tighten value types
3. Move the keys closer to English language
4. Amend with versioning and selective strictness (prefix marked extensions)

Work in progress ...
