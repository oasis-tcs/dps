# Contributions Area

Below this path /contributions/ the maintainers can receive and organize contributions from external parties to the DPS TC.

To clearly identify the contribution sources, the contributions are stored within folders naming the sources.

## Data and Trust Alliance

For the Data and Trust Alliance (DTA) this is the folder /contributions/dta/.

Any minor fix and cleansing results as well as derivations of related content are stored in folders below the original contribution folders.

For example, a cleansed version of the /contributions/dta/schema/json/data-provenance-standards-1.0.0.schema.json is inside
the /contributions/dta/schema/json/clean/ folder.
Further derivates like instance data are below /contributions/dta/schema/json/clean/instance/ while explorations to transform the schema
into type systems of various general programming languages are placed below /contributions/dta/schema/json/clean/type/.

## OASIS OpenC2 TC

The information model contributions from members of the OASIS OpenC2 TC are stored below /contributions/openc2/.

For example, the information model contribution is to be found below /contributions/openc2/im/.
