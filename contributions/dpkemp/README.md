# DPS Information Model

Working aids to support development of the DPS metadata specification:

* [Information modeling summary](docs/im-summary.md): Why develop format-agnostic data interchange specifications?
* Python [package](jadn) (work-in-progress) for processing JADN information models
* CLI [application](apps) to translate JADN schemas across multiple formats. Includes DPS schema experiments.
* Example [ISO 3166](geography) geographic country and subdivision data. Complete data for 249 countries
is available if it turns out to be useful to support DPS geographic restrictions.
