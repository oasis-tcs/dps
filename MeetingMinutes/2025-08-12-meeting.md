## Discussion Summary

### 1. **Welcome**
- Bryan opened the meeting and confirmed quorum.  
- Reminder that today’s agenda includes specification alignment, content refinement, and outreach planning.

### 2. **Specification discussion**
- Kristina summarized the D&TA working group’s approach:
  - Defaults to “worldwide” with possible country-specific exclusions.
  - Uses inclusion/exclusion lists rather than requiring exhaustive country-by-country coding.
  - Avoids prescriptive compliance labels; instead provides factual metadata so implementers can decide compliance.
- Stefan raised concerns about ambiguity when fields are empty vs. explicitly set; suggested defining semantics for “empty,” “allow,” and “deny.”
- David proposed introducing priority layers for allow/deny logic to resolve conflicts (e.g., allow worldwide, exclude Italy).
- Group agreed on:
  - Need for explicit definitions and examples.
  - Possible creation of a simple “examples” directory showing schema instances.
  - Future consideration of controlled vocabularies and value catalogs.

### 3. **Use cases document updates**
- Lisa and Stefan continuing edits; next release targeted for next week.
- Members encouraged to submit final feedback this week.
- Agreement to align examples with updated schema definitions.
- Consider adding:
  - Simplistic “worldwide except…” examples.
  - Step-through persona-based scenarios showing metadata creation and application.

### 4. **Executive brief updates**
- Most comments resolved; one outstanding item on adding a high-level executive checklist or summary call-out.
- Jane will reformat into a slide deck for visual presentation; target completion before next meeting.
- Stefan suggested exploring an OASIS Technical Report format for broader conference and outreach use.

### 5. **Secretary role transition**
- Kristina announced she will roll off from D&TA at end of August; new TC secretary needed.
- Call for volunteers; role described as manageable and a good vantage point for committee work.
- If no volunteer by next meeting, co-chairs may temporarily assume responsibilities.

### 6. **Social Media and Outreach Plan**
- Jane presented an ambitious draft plan:
  - Content calendar through December.
  - Cross-promotion with other OASIS TCs.
  - Tracking performance metrics for posts.
  - Outreach to external blogs, conferences, and media (e.g., RSA blog post and CFP submission by Aug 18).
  - Member and partner logo usage guidelines.
- Request for TC volunteers and possible marketing contacts from member organizations to assist.
- Discussion on involving D&TA companies and other implementers in amplification efforts.
